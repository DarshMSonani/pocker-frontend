        <h2>Playing Rules For Teen Patti</h2>
        <p class="rules-desc">
          Teen Patti, similar to poker, is really a famous Indian casino card game. It's usually played in a
          group of three to six people with a 52-card deck sans jokers. Three cards are handed face down to
          each participant. The boot amount is sent and received by each player before the cards are dealt.
          The amount was its smallest bet amount that may be put into the pot, which would be the money there
          in the middle of the table. The pot amount rises as the play progressed, and the winner of that hand
          wins it. The champion is really the player that stays as in the game to the end of the hand and has
          the best or highest hand.
